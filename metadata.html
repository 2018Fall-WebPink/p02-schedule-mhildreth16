        <main><p>Chick-fil-a is a fast food place that only sells chicken, but the mascot is a cow. I love Chick-fil-a because they are really clean and family oriented they also use real white meat chicken! Chick-fil-a is a great place to get a quick bite to eat with family or friends. Chick-fil-a's most popular meal is the number 1 which is a basic chicken sandwhich with pickle, medium fries, and a medium drink. Which is my favorite meal to get everytime I go with my friends. They also offer a wide variety you can get chiken nuggets, spicy chicken sandwhiches, grilled chicken bites, grilled chicken sandwhich, chicken salads and more!</p></main>
        
        <footer>This is why I believe that chick-fil-a is better than any other fast food restaurants. Although, the food is amazing the customer service is just as good. They provide you with table to table service tending to your every need, clean up your trash when you are done and just feel like hanging out, free refills, and free mints!</footer>
